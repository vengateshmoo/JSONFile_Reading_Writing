1.What is a Json File?
JSON----> Stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON File------> A file contains,JSON Object with .json file Extension
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.Why do we need JSON?
    In this modern era, we have  lot of programming languages.
    Almost all of as use different webservices in our daily life
    (Eg.Weather report,Currency conversion,enquiring Gold Rates,cricket Scores)
    our browser is the point of concept,to make the request to the server,
    receive the response from the server,process the repponse and render it to user.
    A Web server may be implemented with any programing languages like java,python,etc.
    our browser can understand JavaScript.so there has to be a common,
    language independent data transmission between a web application and a web server.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JSON is a light weight data-interchange format
JSON is a "self-describing" and easy to understand
JSON is language independent.
